Plane Strain

Ray Clough utilised the word Finite Element Method first time in the world in his article "The Finite Element Method in Plane Stress Analysis" which was published in the Proceedings of the 2nd ASCE Conference in Electronic Computation September 8-9, 1960, Pittsburgh, USA. In this lab you will solve his example problem with the same mesh and a denser one. Thus, you will consider a dam under hydrostatic pressure in 2-D. Consequently, you will consider the plane stress analysis.

To simplify the constitutive law, the material is isotropic and linear. Extend the dpSolver object to consider also this problem so that the main.m file can be executed without errors. You cannot assume that there is only one domain tag, though in this example there is only one.

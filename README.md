Primitive platform for programming finite element method solvers in Matlab. To be utilized in educational purposes. Also, exercise problems are provided.

Mesh generator is not included. The platform utilizes Gmsh for mesh creation and it can also read Comsol 4.x .mshtxt files.

This platform is utilized in course Numerical methods for field computations at Tampere University of Technology, Tampere, Finland. Students will program with this platform their own Galerkin FEM solvers for

- 3-D Laplace problems
- 2-D Poisson problems
- Linear isotropic elasticity

Primitive object-oriented platform for programming finite element method solvers in Matlab. To be utilized in educational purposes. Examples and exercise problems are provided. Solvers are not included (students should do those themselves). If you are an educator and would like to get the example solvers, please contact author (antti@stenvall.fi).

Mesh generator is not included. The platform utilizes Gmsh for mesh creation and it can also read Comsol 4.x .mshtxt files. If you want to use Gmsh from dp, install it to dp/gmsh/ folder. In Windows, if you have gmsh.exe there, it works rightaway!

This platform is utilized in course Numerical methods for field computations at Tampere University of Technology, Tampere, Finland. Students will program with this platform their own Galerkin FEM solvers for

- 3-D Laplace problems
- 2-D Poisson problems
- Linear isotropic elasticity

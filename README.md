Primitive platform for programming finite element method solvers in Matlab. To be utilized in education purposes. Also, exercises are provided.

Mesh generator is not included. The platform utilizes Gmsh for mesh creation and it can also read Comsol .mshtxt files.

This platform is utilized in course Numerical methods for field computations at Tampere University of Technology, Tampere, Finland. Students will program in side this platform their own Galerkin FEM solvers for

- 3-D Laplace problems
- 2-D Poisson problems
- Linear isotropic elasticity

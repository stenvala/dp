dpMeshPro
==

You will extend the dpMesh class here with functionalities that are strictly mesh related but are needed in solving problems. For example, all the basis functions related stuff should locate here. Don't add anything to dpMesh. Use it as served and make this class professional one which you can use later to make money.
